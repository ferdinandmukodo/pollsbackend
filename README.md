# Polls-Backend

### Introduction
Youâ€™re probably already aware that it can be hard to find the right restaurant and some times when you do and visit it, you find that it is not what you expected.You've been searching for a new restaurant to try, but it's hard to tell which ones are good. What if you could just go online and find them instantly?  

To solve this problem,  I have decided to create a restaurant finder app that helps people who are new to the area and looking for a good place to eat. Through sharing the restaurants details and also the food that they serve. You can judged how good the restaurant is from the reviews that users share.

In order to get information about different restaurantsand the dishes that they serve, I have create an api for faciliattng fetching of the data from the backend. Restro-backend.

Restro-backend API is an application programming interface that provides data and information about restaurants, different dishes that the restaurants sell and the reviews that users have posted about the restaurants.
